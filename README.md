# **Basketball Game Predictor — 2025 Wharton High School Data Science Competition**
*A machine learning model that predicts NCAA women’s basketball game outcomes (final predictions provided in repository) and an algorithm that ranks divisions using an Elo rating system, both created using Google Collaboratory*
## Competition Background
 This repo includes all the work my teammates and I did for the 2025 Wharton High School Data Science Competition, where we analyzed data from over 5,300 NCAA Women’s Division I basketball games. The competition asked us to rank teams within each region and predict who would win in hypothetical East Region matchups. In this repository, you’ll find our solutions for both Task A (ranking teams) and Task B (predicting game outcomes), as well as the final predictions we submitted.

## Project Details
 For this project, I built an Elo rating system that updated following each game, applying a system of rewards and penalties based on how well teams actually performed compared to expectations. We also used the Task B's Elo model in Task A, to produce the team rankings at the end of the season for each division. For predicting individual game outcomes, I chose to use multiple linear regression. Looking back, I understand this wasn’t the best modeling choice for this problem, but it was what I ended up implementing for this particular project and it helped me learn a lot about handling sports data and building models from scratch.
	
 One challenge we ran into was that the regression model sometimes produced extremely high or low win probabilities that didn’t make sense in practice. To address this, we iterated through the prediction DataFrame after generating the initial results and adjusted the expectation probability function to bring them closer to a realistic range. Overall, working on this project provided me with significant insight into feature engineering, building models like Elo systems, and collaborating as part of a team on a large data science project. Ultimately, this competition sparked my interest in Artificial Intelligence, and I plan to continue exploring AI and machine learning to better my understanding and, most importantly, create positive impacts on society.
